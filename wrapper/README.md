# bsdiff.NET Wrapper

The regular bsdiff C code has been converted to Rust code using [Corrode](https://github.com/jameysharp/corrode). Why? Because C is awful that's why.

As a result, this Rust code is still licensed under the regular bsdiff license: [bsdiff LICENSE file on GitHub](https://github.com/mendsley/bsdiff/blob/master/LICENSE)
